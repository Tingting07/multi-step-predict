# multi-step-predict
This is a purely data-driven precipitation forecast.To address the challenges of the prediction accuracy in multi-feature multi-step rainfall, this study proposes a hybrid model with Variational mode decomposition (VMD), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as encoder and decoder for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network, and cross attention mechanism (CATNet).
